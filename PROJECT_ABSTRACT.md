- **Search Functionality:** City-based search with case-insensitive regex matching across all listings

#### 2.3 Review & Rating System
- Star-based rating system (1-5 stars) with customizable CSS animations
- Nested review schema with references to listings and review authors
- Cascade delete functionality to remove associated reviews when a listing is deleted
- Server-side validation using Joi schema validation for review data integrity
- Real-time display of all reviews with author information and timestamps

#### 2.4 Database Architecture
- **MongoDB Atlas:** Cloud-hosted database deployment for scalability and reliability
- **Three Primary Models:**
  - **User Model:** Authentication with passport-local-mongoose plugin, email and username fields
  - **Listing Model:** Comprehensive property data including title, description, location, price, images, owner reference, reviews array, and geoJSON geometry
  - **Review Model:** Rating, comment, author reference, and timestamp fields
- **Data Relationships:** One-to-many relationships between users and listings (ownership), listings and reviews (nested documents with population)
- **Middleware Integration:** Automatic cleanup of associated reviews upon listing deletion

#### 2.5 Frontend Development
- **Template Engine:** EJS (Embedded JavaScript) with ejs-mate for layout management

- HTTP-only cookies for session security
- Server-side validation with Joi schemas to prevent malicious input
- Authorization checks to prevent unauthorized access to protected resources
- Environment variable protection for sensitive credentials (database URLs, API keys, session secrets)

#### 3.3 Data Validation
- **Client-Side:** HTML5 form validation with required attributes
- **Server-Side:** Joi schema validation for listing and review objects
- **Validation Rules:**
  - Listing: title, description, location, country, price (minimum 0)
  - Review: rating (1-5), required comment field

#### 3.4 API Integrations
- **OpenStreetMap Nominatim API:** Address to coordinate conversion for geocoding
- **Cloudinary API:** Image upload, storage, and transformation services
- **Leaflet.js + CartoDB Tiles:** Interactive mapping with custom tile layers

### 5. Development Challenges & Solutions

#### Challenge 1: Geocoding Implementation
**Problem:** Converting human-readable addresses to geographic coordinates  
**Solution:** Integrated OpenStreetMap Nominatim API with both server-side (during listing creation) and client-side (fallback) geocoding approaches

#### Challenge 2: Image Upload & Cloud Storage
**Problem:** Storing and managing listing images efficiently  
**Solution:** Implemented multer middleware with Cloudinary storage, enabling automatic image optimization and CDN delivery

#### Challenge 3: Authorization & Security
**Problem:** Ensuring users can only edit/delete their own content  
**Solution:** Created custom middleware (isOwner, isReviewAuthor) to verify resource ownership before allowing modifications

#### Challenge 4: Responsive Design
**Problem:** Creating a mobile-friendly interface  
**Solution:** Leveraged Bootstrap 5 grid system with responsive breakpoints, flexbox utilities, and custom CSS adjustments

#### Challenge 5: Database Relationships
**Problem:** Maintaining data integrity with nested reviews and user references  
**Solution:** Implemented Mongoose population methods and cascade delete hooks to manage relationships and orphaned data
